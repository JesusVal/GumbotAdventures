# singleton-adapter-practice

Using the code from previous practice:

* Make your membership class a singleton class
* Create a new different membersip type interface with 3 methods
* Add an adapter from this new membership type interface to the existing memberships

Also make sure you complete the following checkpoints:
* Add unit tests to all concrete classes
* Have clean reports from Findbugs, Checkstyle and PMD
